#### 1: Surprising power of  atomic habits

Habits are like compound interest of self improvement. Getting one percent improvement every day accommodates for a lot in the long run.

Small changes appeared to make no difference untill you crossed a critical threshold to see a noticeable improvement. Ice melting example or coumping interest is a delayed process and you need to be patient.

Atomic habits are part of the large system and are like the building blocks.

And if you want better results, stop focussing on your goals rather start focussing on your system or process. Getting better in small things you do will eventually help to accomplish your goals.

#### 2: How your habits shape your identity(vice versa)

Your habits change your identity and your identify further shape your habits.

Always try to be the person who does all that sort of things that you want to become your habits. You need to know who you want to be. Choose your identity.

Be as musician rather than just learning a guitar or be a healthy person rather than just want to avoid junk food.

There are 3 levels of change; outcome , process and identity based changes and most efficient one is to not focus on outcomes based rather the identity one.

The real reason why habits matter is so that you can change your beliefs and continuously edit them to become a better person.

#### 3: How to build better habits in 4 simple steps

Habit is a behaviour that's repeated enough times to be automatic.
 
feedback loop:

Cue: initiates a behaviour or trigger a craving 
Craving: motivates the response
Response: provides the reward
Reward: satisfies the craving

This is endless habit loop and failure to satisfy any step will not result in habit

Key to How to follow above for habits and do the opposite for getting rid of bad ones

Cue: how to make it obvious | invisible
Craving: how to make it attractive | unattractive
Response: how to make it easy |difficult
Reward: how to make it satisfying | unsatisfying

### MAKE IT OBVIOUS

#### 4: Man who didn't look right

Be aware of your behaviour to change your habits. Pointing and calling out can help to make this obvious and then you can take the right action on those behaviours if that is what you want in or out of your life.

With enough practice your brain will pick up on cues automatically.

#### 5: Best way to start a new habit

Be specific with your plan of time and location and execution and call that out so that your plan is not derailed bcoz of unclarity.

Try to call out ex:
I will do [behaviour] at [time] in [location]

Habit stacking is another way to introduce new habits in your already set routine or habits. Try to pair any new habit after your current habits to develop new ones. Ex:
After I complete (current habit/behaviour), I will do (new habbit).

#### 6: Motivation is overrated; environment often matters most

Make the cue obvious in your env and relate a cue to context. Habits can be associate with a context

#### 7: The secret to self control

Make it obvious

Make the cues invisible from your environment to avoid bad habits.
Make it more difficult to adopt.

Its believed that bad habits can be avoided but not forgoteable. Hence as soon as the cue to bad habits  is visible it just kicks in.

### MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE

#### 8: How to make habits irrestible


Habits are dopemine drive feedback loop.  It's the anticipation of the reward not fulfilment that drives us. Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive ex:

Pair an action you want to do with the pair of action you need to do. Try doing this with habit stacking.

#### 9: Role of family and friends in shaping your habit

Try to be in the group where normal behaviour is your desired behavior. 

We tend to imitate the habits of 3 social groups: closed ones(family/friends), many and successful/powerful ones.

#### 10: How to get rid of bad habits

Make bad habits unattractive and highlight the benefits of avoiding them. 

### MAKE IT EASY

#### 11: Walk slowly but never backwards

Most effective way to practice habit is to make it easy.
Most effective form of learning is practically not planning.

Focus on taking actions not being emotional.

Repetition makes the behaviour more automatic.

The amount of time you spent forming a habit is not as important as number of times you have spent doing it.
 
#### 12: The law of least effort

We naturally tend to gravitate towards the action of least amount of work.
Create the environment for doing right things as easy as possible.
Reduce the friction associated with good behaviours, when frictions is low habits are easy. Similarly, increase the friction for bad behaviours. When friction Iis high, habits are difficult.

#### 13: Stop procrastinating with 2 min rule

Employ the 2 minute rule to start something or initiate a habit behaviour whenever you are struggling with new habits. Those 2 minutes of trickibg will help you to continue further steps to achieve a habit.
The more you ritualise the starting process the more you can fell deep to practice the behaviour.
Standardise before you optimize. 
Master the decisive time.

#### 14: How to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible

Automate your habits as much as possible. Use technology to automate the regular take so you can invest the time where machines can't help.

### MAKE IT SATISFYING

#### 15: The cardinal rule of behaviour change

Habits needs to be enjoyable to last long. We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.
What is immediately rewarded is repeated.

#### 16: How to stick with good habits everyday:

Track your progress with a habit track as progress is the biggest motivation to adopt any new habits.
Do not miss the habits more than once and fallback to habit asap.

#### 17: How accountability partner can change everything.

Make bad habits painful and have a sort of contract or public obligation, where in people know about your habit behaviours and  punish yourself if you don't fulfill the habit.

### GO FROM MERELY GOOD TO GREAT

#### 18: The truth about talent (when genes matter and when they don't):

The secret to maximising your odds of success is to choose the right field of success. Pick the right habit that comes easy and work hard on it. 
Habits are easier when they aligned with your natural abilities (genes/nature). 
Choose the habits that better suits you. Play the game that favours you or create one that favours you if it doesn't exist.
Genes tell us what to work hard on.

#### 19: The goldilocks rule: How to stay motivated in life and work

The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored if the routine or habits. It's the ability to keep going that makes us successful.

#### 20: The downside of creating good habits

The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little details. The lack of awareness is poison.
Habits plus deliberate practice equals mastery 

Reflection and review is a process that allows us to remain consious of our performance over time.

### CONCLUSION

21:The secret to result that last;

Tiny changes remarkable results.
