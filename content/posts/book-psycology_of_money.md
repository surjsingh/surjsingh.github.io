#### Introduction:

Soft skills are more important than the technical skills. Behaviours matters.


#### 1. No one's crazy
	
	The way ppl save and invest money varies alot with their behaviours around their generation like where they were born and brought up or the economies they were brought up in. Also the behaviours of their parents with respect to money and investing. Also around what was booming in the industry i.e stocks or inflation, when they were trying to invest while young Adult along with some luck.
	
#### 2. Luck and Risk

  Risk and luck are hard to pin down. The line between inspiringly bold and foolishly reckless can be a millimetre thick and only visible with a hindsight. Risk and luck are dopplaganger.

  The difficulty is idetifying what is risk, luck and skill is one of the biggest problems we face when trying to learn about the best waynto manage money but can be tackled thought two things: be careful who you wish to admire.

  Always keep in mind when judging ppl including yourself that not all success is due to hardwork and not all poverty is due to laziness.
  Avoid implementing the success stories of extreme successful ppl and the odds of luck they had is not going to be in your life. The more the extreme the less likely it's going to be commonly applied to your life.
  Success is a lousy teacher and it's do to smart ppl  thinking that they can't loose. When things are going extremely well realize its not as good as you think. You are not invincible and if you acknowledge luck brought you success and you have to believe in luck's cousin risk, which can turn your story around quickly.
  Similarly, failure can be a lousy teacher bcoz  it's do to smart ppl thinking they have made terrible decisions when sometimes they just reflect the unforgiving realities of risk. The trick in dealing with failures is range your financial decisions of life in a way that a bad investment here and a missed financial goal won't wipe you out.

  Always leave room to judge failures or success as nothing is just as good or as bad as it seems 

#### 3. Never enough.
	
  Never risk something that  you want and is important onto something which is unimportant and you don't want.
  Knowing what is enough for you is very important. Eat enough that suffice your hunger as overeating usually causes trouble and inconvenience.

#### 4. Confounding compounding

  Wealth only grows when its accumulated over a long term. For example take the example of how technology is growing way back in 1980 to 2020 start investing for long term wealth. It's not a quick one but a fruitful one. Ex: warren buffets major wealth just came after he turned 50 years.

####	5. Getting wealthy vs staying wealthy:

  We must always think about how to earn  and then trying to keep it. For example in stock markets, always try to take profits and do not get heavily invested and always take out some cash in order to survive the bear market so you don't have to sell your stocks at low price. Be optimist and always try  believe in the compounding investment power.

  Getting less rich but doing that consistently will make you successful. So have a appropriate plan. Do not greedy and do your risk management.

####	6. Tails, you win

  The best way to get success is to keep a long term investment and do not get nervous by rain or shine. Invest systematically over a long term and always try out new things and doing so may result in failure or wrong decisions but will also bring few success which will outshine all failures. You can be wrong 50 % of the time and still be wealthy.

####	7. Freedom

  Control your life by having a choice of doing whatever you want where you want with the ppl you want to is great life time variable to happiness.

  Gaining the ability to have enough wealth so you can still manage without your job for 6 months is freedom and flexibility for you to carry on.

  Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.

####	8. Man in the car paradox

  Humility kindness and empathy will bring you more respect than any fancy cars or houses if you looking to impress others.

####	9. Wealth is what you don't see.

  There is big difference between being rich Vs wealthy. Wealth is something that you don't see and hence can not get easily inspired by that, where as rich is something that you see in ppl around you buying expensive cars or houses but it doesn't necessarily mean they have wealth. 
  
  Keep an eye on ppl who are modest yet wealthy Vs ppl who are rich and lives on the razors edge of insolvency. Keep this in when judging others success and comparing it with your own goals.

####	10. Save Money

  Try to save Money as much as possible because that gives greater freedom and strength to try out new things with more freedom and flexibility. The world is changing fast and you need good support system in the form of savings to have greater control over your life.

####	11.  Reasoneable >  Rational

  Be always reasonable than Rational as that has greater chance of getting completed.

####	13. Room for error:

  We always need a plan that has a Room for error. You need to have plan for you initial plan not going well. Hence in stocks or investing always have some cash handy to buy the stock's when they dip. You might not earn extra profits sometimes with idle cash but it will prepare you to deal with unforseen events in a better way and making more profits. Similarly save money for in predictable events even if you don't have any specific plan. Always think that nothing will execute perfectly and prepare for that room for error.

####	16. You'll and me:

  You need to play your own game depending on your time horizon. Do not invest in something by looking at others time frames. Try to find your purpose and reason and play accordingly.

#### 17: seduction of pessimism:

  Exoecting bad outcomes always reduces the expectation between the actual and desires outcomes. Even it brings sense of surprise if it didn't happen and is sort of optimism. Optimism comes from the history of events and when you have understanding about what's happening and how can it change the world.

#### 18: when you'll believe anything:

#### 19: All together now

  Always prepare yourself for things that are unpredictable like financial advice. Always have room for error in.
