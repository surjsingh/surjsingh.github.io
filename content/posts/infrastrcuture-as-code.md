If you feel you are putting too much efforts in managing your dynamic infrastructure or if you are bogged down by the instability of your infrastructure or probably doesn't feel confident to push unattended changes across your infrastructure, this talk is what you've been looking for. 

We'll start with some challenges that we face when we manually handle the infrastructure, discuss some principals of IaC and how tools and practices, when applied to IaC, from the software engineering can help us to manage the Infrastructure confidently. Finally we'll look at some examples and demo to get some more understanding around IaC. Terraform as IaC tool along with AWS cloud just happens to be the medium for the demo.
