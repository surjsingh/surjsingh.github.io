Infrastructure as Code tools create the opportunity to work in ways that help you to deliver changes more frequently, quickly, and reliably, improving the overall quality of your systems. But the benefits donâ€™t come from the tools themselves. They come from how you use them. The trick is to leverage the technology to embed quality, reliability, and compliance into the process of making changes.

This edition introduces three core practices for using Infrastructure as Code to make changes safely and easily:

Define everything as code
This one is obvious from the name, and creates repeatability and consistency.

Continuously test and deliver all work in progress
Each change enhances safety. It also makes it possible to move faster and with more confidence.

Build small, simple pieces that you can change independently
These are easier and safer to change than larger pieces.

Benefits of Infrastructure as Code:

To summarize, organizations adopting Infrastructure as Code to manage dynamic infrastructure hope to achieve benefits, including:Using IT infrastructure as an enabler for rapid delivery of valueReducing the effort and risk of making changes to infrastructureEnabling users of infrastructure to get the resources they need, when they need itProviding common tooling across development, operations, and other stakeholdersCreating systems that are reliable, secure, and cost-effectiveMake governance, security, and compliance controls visibleImproving the speed to troubleshoot and resolve failures
